      <h1>About me</h1>
      <div class="line-breaker"></div>
      <p>
        My name is Lam Man Hei Joseph. I am an undergraduate student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I am currently in School of Engineering, and I plan to major in computer science in the next semester.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like doing sports, especially running. I was a member of Cross Country Team in my secondary school. I think running is really interesting and relaxing. Sometimes, I may even join some competition to challenge myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides sports, I also like programming, that’s why I want to major in computer science in the future. I think it can alter the future of the world. We can program the computer to automate some repetitive stuff and to facilitate our work. In my spare
        time, I will work on my own project, such as games and utility tool. Usually, they are just for fun, but sometime they can really help me to do my work.
      </p>

    <div class="sub-topic" id="adventureCamp">
      <h1>Outdoor Adventure Camp</h1>
      <div class="line-breaker"></div>
      <p>
        It was the first time to attend this kind of camp. I have never tried to live in the wild. During the camp, I have learnt something. For example, do not say impossible before you have tried. In the first day night, we have night walk session and we have to walk in total darkness individually. At first, I thought it is impossible and I had to turn on my flash light at sometime. But finally, I finished the challenge without turn on the light, and I felt so surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I learn how to work in a team. In the second day, we had a survival challenge, we needed to go out of the campsite and find food for our dinner. We had to trust the one who was leading us. When we had different idea in the same problem, I learnt to respect the others. Also, we had to take care of our team members, and understand their difficulties so that we can be a team.
      </p>

    <div class="sub-topic" id="SMARTgoal">
      <h1>SMART Goal</h1>
      <div class="line-breaker"></div>
      <p>
        In the redbird journey, we have a chance to set some SMART goal. SMART is stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. I found that I did not have enough sleep in this semester. Also, I realized that I did not have enough knowledge in programming. Therefore, I set up 2 SMART goal to improve my current situation. My first goal was to sleep at least 6 hours a day and my second goal is to learn some programming skill or knowledge online every week.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve these two SMART goal, I split them into small parts in order to achieve the goal step by step. For the first goal, I first set up a smaller goal that I had to sleep for at least 6 hours every 3 days in a week. For the second goal, I found some useful online resource for me to learn first. At the first week, I have completed my small goal successfully, so I started to push myself a little bit. I set the next step to have sufficient sleep in every 4 days a week and learn 1-2 programming skills and knowledge every weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then the difficulties came. As the semester pass, my workload started to increase exponentially. As a result, I found that time totally is not enough for me, and finishing my academic work spend almost all of my time. Therefore, I could not take care of my goal and I started to forget them. Soon, I seldom followed my SMART goal set previously. And now, I still sleep very little a day and sometimes even have to work overnight. Also, there are just little improvement on my programming skills and knowledge. I would say that my SMART goal setting was a failure this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if I have an another chance to set up my SMART goal, I will try to improve the way that I implement. First, the goal should be flexible and adjusted base on my current situation. As I cannot foresee my future when I set my goal, there is chance that I am not able to follow my goal that I have set although it is attainable when I first set my goal. Therefore, I should adjust my goal and my schedule to achieve my goal base on my current situation so that I can still achieve part of my goal in this situation. Also, I should not push myself too hard to achieve the goal as it can let me lose my motivation to attain the goal. I set a pretty fast pace to achieve the goal this time which let me think that it was too difficult for me to achieve. Therefore, I should slow down my pace when necessary. In fact, I decide to set new SMART goals after the semester ended. I hope I can finish the goals in my holiday when I have more free time.

      <h1>Community Service: Elderly Home Visit</h1>
      <div class="line-breaker"></div>
      <p>
        I joined an elderly home visit event held in Lam Tin in April 7, 2018. I have never participated in this kind of service. Therefore, I felt a bit nervous before the event. However, surprisingly, it gave my a brand new experience and my feeling about the society that I am living.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I was worried about what to say to elderly as I was not a talkative person. I was afraid that I have to sit in their home for a couple minutes without saying anything, but luckily, it turned out that it was not the case. I have never thought of how talkative the elderly were. As long as I started to talk with them, they can talk to us for a very long time. I have visited 3 elderly this time, they were all willing to share to us, and sometimes they were curious about us and ask us some question. They share a lot of experiences and their old live to us. For example, an elderly I have visited showed some very old style audio tapes that I have never seen to us. I also know more about Hong Kong in the past, such as the pricing in the past and the building in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found that they were all very happy when we were visiting them as they are seldom be cared. One of them even have difficulty in movement that he can not go out very often, so he often stay alone. Therefore, when we were visiting them, they could feel that we were caring them and feel excited about that. In fact, join this event not only can help the elderly, but also benefit ourselves. As when I saw the happiness in the elderly’s face, I also felt happy from them, and it can also let me relax from my stressful academic life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, I have joined some service learning trips to mainland and helped the poor students there. I thought there were a lot of people in the poor places that we should care about and help them, so I join these trips and hope I could give a hand to them. However, I did not realize that there were also many people in Hong Kong that we should care. This event gave me an opportunity to see another side of Hong Kong. Although Hong Kong is a well-developed country, there are still poor and people who need to help. Therefore, if I have time, I will help not only the people in the world, but also people in Hong Kong.

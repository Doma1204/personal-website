            <p>
                My name is Lam Man Hei Joseph. I am an undergraduate student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
                I am currently in School of Engineering, and I plan to major in computer science in the next semester.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like doing sports, especially running. I was a member of Cross Country Team in my secondary school.
              I think running is really interesting and relaxing. Sometimes, I may even join some competition to challenge myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides sports, I also like programming, that’s why I want to major in computer science in the future.
              I think it can alter the future of the world. We can program the computer to automate some repetitive stuff and to facilitate our work.
              In my spare time, I will work on my own project, such as games and utility tool. Usually, they are just for fun, but sometime they can really help me to do my work.
            </p>
